# iris_identification_tutorial

The iris identification tutorial provides an introduction to using the sklearn module in Python. The tutorial covers loading, summarizing and visualizing data using pandas and matplot lib, producing validation datasets, evaluating 6 different machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, linear disrimination analysis, Kneighbours classifier, decision tree classifier, guassian NB and support vector machine), comparing machine learning algorithms and making predictions using the validation dataset generated. The full tutorial is provided below.
